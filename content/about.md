# About

Hey there! 👋 My name is Nimrod. In my work life I spend most of my time writing and thinking about software. However, in my spare time I like to read books, play board games with my family and dabble with maths. 

When my brain is rot -  I like to do lots sports (e.g. Rock Climbing and Running).
